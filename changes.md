### Fixed
- Resolved Firebase initialization errors by:
    - Standardizing Firebase SDK imports to use CDN URLs in `public/script.js`.
    - Correcting the `storageBucket` URL in `public/script.js` to match the Firebase project configuration.
    - Removing redundant Firebase initialization script from `public/index.html`.
- Addressed browser caching issues that were preventing updated files from loading by recommending a hard refresh.

### [May 12, 2025 - 00:55 UTC+8]

- **Modified `fetchAppSettings` function in `public/script.js`:**
    - Ensured that if the evaluation period transitions from closed (`isOpen: false`) to open (`isOpen: true`) and a user is currently logged in, the `setupEvaluationUI()` function is explicitly called.
    - This change forces a refresh of necessary data, particularly the list of peers to evaluate (`peersToEvaluate`), resolving an issue where users might see "no peers to evaluate" even if peers exist after evaluations reopen.
    - Similar refresh logic was added to the `catch` block of `fetchAppSettings` to handle cases where defaulting to an open state on error might cause a similar transition.
    - This addresses the problem observed where an active user (e.g., Alice) would not see available peers after the evaluation period was reopened by an admin, as the peer list was not being re-fetched.

### [May 12, 2025 - 01:03 UTC+8]

- **Added enhanced debugging to data retrieval functions in `public/script.js`:**
  - Added detailed logging to `fetchPeersForEvaluation` to track the processing of each retrieved user and verify peer filtering logic
  - Added comprehensive step-by-step logging to `setupEvaluationUI` to monitor the data retrieval and processing flow
  - Created a diagnostic admin script `admin-scripts/check-users.js` to verify database contents and simulate peer filtering logic
  - These changes will help diagnose why users aren't seeing peers for evaluation despite peers existing in the database 

### [May 12, 2025 - 01:22 UTC+8]

- **Enhanced Robustness in `public/script.js` for Question Handling:**
    - Modified `loadEvaluationForm` to check if `categorizedQuestions` is null or empty before attempting to render the evaluation form. If so, an error message is displayed to the user, and form rendering is halted. This prevents potential JavaScript errors and a broken UI state if questions fail to load.
    - Modified `handleSubmitEvaluation` to perform a similar check for `categorizedQuestions` before processing the submission. If questions are missing, an error message is shown, and the submission is prevented.
    - These changes address potential scenarios where the application might appear "stuck" or "in a loop" if evaluation questions are not available, by providing clear feedback and preventing script errors. 

### [May 12, 2025 - 01:37 UTC+8]

- **Refactored UI Initialization and State Management in `public/script.js`:**
    - Modified `handleLogin()`: After a successful code login and `currentUserProfile` is set, it now directly calls `await setupEvaluationUI()`. This makes `handleLogin` the primary trigger for setting up the UI for a logged-in user.
    - Modified `setupEvaluationUI()`: This function is now responsible for fetching application settings (e.g., `isEvaluationOpen`) at its beginning. It integrates the logic to check if the evaluation period was just reopened by an admin and resets relevant state variables (`allEvaluationsDoneForCurrentUserInThisOpenPeriod`, `evaluatedPeerFirestoreIds`, `evaluationSessionJustResetByAdmin`) accordingly.
    - Modified `onAuthStateChanged()`: Removed the direct call to `setupEvaluationUI()` for authenticated users. Its main role is now to manage `currentFirebaseUser` and reset the UI to a signed-out state (clearing user-specific data like `currentUserProfile`, `peersToEvaluate`, etc.) when the user signs out or auth state is lost. This prevents premature UI setup calls before `currentUserProfile` is established through code login.
    - The `fetchAppSettings()` function's role in the login flow is now significantly reduced, as its core logic for determining `isEvaluationOpen` and handling reopening scenarios is integrated into `setupEvaluationUI()`. It's retained with comments about its diminished role in this specific flow.
    - This refactoring addresses a race condition where `setupEvaluationUI` could be called by `onAuthStateChanged` before `currentUserProfile` was populated by `handleLogin`, leading to the "no peers to evaluate" issue even when peers existed.
- **Added Diagnostic Logging for Script Version Confirmation:**
    - Added a distinct `console.log("NEW_LOG_POINT_AFTER_RENDERPEERLIST_DEBUG: ...")` in `renderPeerList()` to help confirm that the browser is running the latest deployed version of `script.js`, aiding in diagnosing caching issues. 

## [2025-05-12 02:23 AM UTC+8] - Code Refactor: Modularization

### Summary
This set of changes completes a major refactor of the client-side JavaScript code for the peer evaluation application. The monolithic `public/script.js` has been broken down into several distinct modules, each with a specific responsibility, improving code organization, maintainability, and readability. A new `public/js/main.js` file now serves as the central orchestrator for the application.

### Modules Created in `public/js/`:

*   **`config.js`**: (Created in a previous session, but part of this overall refactor goal)
    *   Stores static configuration like Firebase project details.
*   **`state.js`**: 
    *   Manages the global client-side state of the application (e.g., `currentUserProfile`, `isEvaluationOpen`, `peersToEvaluate`, etc.).
    *   Exports getter (`getState`) and setter functions for all state variables.
    *   Includes functions to reset parts of the state (e.g., `resetUserEvaluationState`).
*   **`firebaseInit.js`**:
    *   Initializes the Firebase app, Auth, and Firestore services.
    *   Exports the initialized `app`, `auth`, and `db` instances.
*   **`uiElements.js`**:
    *   Contains selectors for all static DOM elements used by the application.
    *   Exports these elements for use by other UI-related modules.
    *   Also includes references for dynamically created container elements like `peerEvaluationSummaryContainer`, `evaluationClosedMessage`, and `statsVisualizationContainer` which are appended to the DOM by `main.js`.
*   **`uiHelpers.js`**:
    *   Provides simple UI utility functions such as `showLoading`, `hideLoading`, `showError`, and `showSuccess`.
*   **`firestoreService.js`**:
    *   Handles all direct interactions with Firebase Firestore.
    *   Includes functions for: user login (`loginUserWithCode`), fetching questions (`fetchCategorizedQuestions`, `fetchAllQuestions`), fetching peers (`fetchPeersForEvaluation`), fetching/submitting evaluations (`fetchUserSubmittedEvaluations`, `submitEvaluation`), saving/fetching summarized evaluations (`saveSummarizedEvaluation`, `fetchUserSummarizedEvaluations`), and listening to app settings changes (`listenToAppSettings`).
    *   `listenToAppSettings` now uses a callback mechanism to inform `main.js` of changes.
*   **`authService.js`**:
    *   Manages Firebase Authentication.
    *   Includes functions for anonymous sign-in (`performAnonymousSignIn`) and setting up the `onAuthStateChanged` listener (`setupAuthListener`).
    *   `setupAuthListener` uses callbacks to inform `main.js` of auth state changes.
*   **`evaluationManager.js`**:
    *   Contains the core business logic for the evaluation process.
    *   Functions include: `handleLogin`, `setupEvaluationUI` (data fetching and state update part), `loadEvaluationForm` (data preparation part), `handleSubmitEvaluation`, `checkCompletionInternal`, `checkCompletionAndRefresh`, and `calculateAndGetPeerAveragesFromState` (and its internal counterpart).
    *   Relies on `firestoreService.js` for data, `state.js` for state, and `uiHelpers.js` for basic UI feedback. Delegates complex rendering.
*   **`uiRenderer.js`**:
    *   Responsible for rendering all complex UI components.
    *   Functions include: `renderPeerList`, `renderEvaluationForm`, `displayPeerEvaluationSummary`, `renderEvaluationChart`, `togglePeerStatsDropdown`, `populatePeerStats`, and `clearEvaluationForm`.
    *   The central function `updateMainUI(appState, interactionCallbacks)` orchestrates which sections and components are visible based on the overall application state, and uses callbacks passed from `main.js` to connect user interactions back to the application logic.
    *   Includes `setupGlobalClickListenerForDropdowns` to manage dropdown behavior.
*   **`main.js`**:
    *   The new entry point and orchestrator for the application.
    *   Imports all other modules.
    *   Initializes Firebase, listeners (auth, app settings), and event handlers for UI elements.
    *   Defines `refreshUI()` which calls `uiRenderer.updateMainUI()` with the current state and interaction callbacks.
    *   Interaction callbacks link UI events to `evaluationManager.js` functions or `firestoreService.js` data fetches, triggering `refreshUI()` on completion.
    *   Manages the logic for handling app state changes originating from listeners (e.g., admin reopening evaluation) and appropriately updating state and UI.
    *   Appends dynamically created UI containers (summary, closed message, chart canvas) to the DOM on startup.

### Changes to Existing Files:

*   **`public/index.html`**:
    *   The script import for `script.js` was removed.
    *   A new script import for `public/js/main.js` (type module) was added.
*   **`public/script.js`**:
    *   All JavaScript code was removed.
    *   A deprecation notice was added, directing to `public/js/main.js`.

### Goals of Refactoring:

*   **Modularity**: Separate concerns into distinct files, making the codebase easier to understand, navigate, and maintain.
*   **Readability**: Improve code clarity with focused modules and JSDoc-style comments for major functions.
*   **Scalability**: Provide a more organized structure for future feature additions or modifications.
*   **Maintainability**: Reduce complexity within single files, making debugging and updates more manageable.
*   **Adherence to Software Engineering Principles**: Promote better code organization and structure.

### Next Steps (User Action):

*   Thoroughly test all application functionalities to ensure the refactor did not introduce regressions.
    *   Login, peer list, evaluation form, submission, completion states, admin open/close scenarios, summary/chart display, stats dropdowns.
*   Verify console for any errors during operation. 

- **[Date_Time_Placeholder]**
    - Refactored `public/js/debugService.js` and `public/js/state.js` to break circular dependency. `debugService` now has an internal flag for debug mode, settable by `state.js`, to resolve `state is not defined` error during login.
    - Corrected import and usage of `setClientJustProcessedGlobalReset` in `public/js/evaluationManager.js` to resolve `state is not defined` error.

- **May 12, 2025, 03:34 AM UTC+8**
    - Modified `setupEvaluationUI` in `public/js/evaluationManager.js` to be more robust against data fetching errors. 
    - If critical data (e.g., peers) fails to load, `checkCompletionInternal` is not called in a way that could incorrectly mark the user as complete.
    - Ensured that `allEvaluationsDoneForCurrentUserInThisOpenPeriod` is explicitly set to `false` if data fetching fails, preventing a user from appearing "complete" due to an error.
    - Added explicit clearing of local submission state (`setUserSubmissions([])`, `setEvaluatedPeerFirestoreIds(new Set())`) within `setupEvaluationUI` if `shouldFetchPreviousSubmissions` is false and it's not a global admin reset (where main.js handles clearing). This ensures a cleaner state if submissions are intentionally skipped for reasons other than a global reset. 

## [May 12, 2025] [03:49:02 AM UTC+8]

- Created `material-ui-ux-guide.md`: A comprehensive Material UI-inspired design framework in Markdown. This guide focuses on CSS styling best practices for achieving an exceptional User Experience (UX), covering principles like clarity, consistency, feedback, efficiency, aesthetics, and accessibility. It details guidelines for layout, color systems, typography, component styling (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.), elevation, iconography, motion, dark mode, and CSS organization. 

## [May 12, 2025] [03:52:43 AM UTC+8]

- **Complete CSS Revamp for Material UI & Marvel Rivals Theme (`public/style.css`)**:
    - Overhauled the entire `public/style.css` to align with Material Design principles and the UX guidelines from `material-ui-ux-guide.md`.
    - Implemented a new color palette: Primary (Maroon `#8C0000`), Secondary (Gold `#FFD700` for accents), Surface (White `#FFFFFF`), Background (Light Gray `#F5F5F5`).
    - Defined and utilized CSS Custom Properties extensively for colors, typography (Poppins, Roboto), spacing (8px grid), border-radius, and shadows, ensuring consistency and maintainability.
    - **Global Styles**: Updated body, container, and heading styles for a modern Material look and feel.
    - **Component Restyling**:
        - **Buttons**: Implemented Contained (primary), Outlined, and Text button variants with Material interaction states (hover, focus, active, disabled).
        - **Input Fields**: Styled text inputs with Material-like bottom borders, focus states, and helper text considerations.
        - **Peer List (`.peer-item`)**: Redesigned as Material list items/cards with elevation and clear `evaluated` state indication.
        - **Evaluation Form**: Styled categories and questions within card-like structures, improving visual hierarchy.
        - **Likert Scales**: Enhanced styling for radio buttons and options for better clarity and interaction.
        - **Dropdowns/Menus**: Styled the ellipsis menu and stats dropdown to match Material menu components with appropriate elevation.
        - **Messages**: Standardized error, success, and info messages to resemble Material snackbars/banners.
        - **Tables (`.summary-table`)**: Applied Material Design table styling for improved readability.
        - **Loading Overlay**: Ensured the spinner uses the primary color and the overlay is consistent with the theme.
    - **Accessibility**: Prioritized readable fonts (Poppins), sufficient color contrast (Maroon/White with appropriate text colors), and visible focus indicators for all interactive elements.
    - **Responsive Design**: Reviewed and refined media queries to ensure Material components adapt well to various screen sizes.
    - **Theme Alignment**: Styled with a "Marvel Rivals team member evaluation" context in mind, aiming for a modern, welcoming, and slightly dynamic/gamer-esque aesthetic within the Material framework. 

## [May 12, 2025] [03:59:50 AM UTC+8]

- **CSS Adjustments and Cleanup (`public/style.css`)**:
    - **Improved Chart Area Spacing**: 
        - Increased padding in `#statsVisualizationContainer` from `var(--spacing-md)` to `var(--spacing-lg)` to reduce a cramped feeling around the chart title and the chart itself.
        - Updated `box-shadow` on `#statsVisualizationContainer` to `var(--shadow-elevation-2)` for better consistency with other card elements.
        - Simplified `.chart-container` styles: removed its individual background, border-radius, box-shadow, and excessive margins, making it a plain wrapper for the chart canvas within `#statsVisualizationContainer`.
    - **Removed Unused CSS Classes**: 
        - Deleted styles for `.peer-item-container` as it was reported unused.
        - Deleted the entire block of styles associated with the ellipsis menu feature, including `.ellipsis-menu`, `.ellipsis-button`, `.dropdown-content`, `.stats-title`, `.stat-category`, `.category-name`, `.category-average`, and `.overall-average`, as this feature was reported unused. 

## [May 12, 2025] [04:02:08 AM UTC+8]

- **Increased Chart Vertical Space (`public/style.css`)**:
    - Modified `.chart-container` to provide more vertical room for the evaluation statistics chart, aiming for better readability of the bar graph elements.
    - Set default `min-height: 450px;`.
    - In `@media (max-width: 768px)` (previously 960px in thought process, but 768px was the actual distinct media query block), set `min-height: 400px;`.
    - In `@media (max-width: 600px)` (previously 480px in thought process, but 600px was the actual distinct media query block), set `min-height: 350px;`. 

## [May 12, 2025] [04:05:05 AM UTC+8]

- **UI/UX Enhancements for Clarity and Symmetry (`public/style.css`)**:
    - **Improved Spacing for Major Content Blocks**:
        - Adjusted `margin-bottom` for `#loginSection`, `#peerList`, and `.peer-evaluation-summary` to `var(--spacing-xl)` for better visual separation between these key functional areas.
        - Added `margin-bottom: var(--spacing-lg);` to `#statsVisualizationContainer` for consistent spacing at the end of the content.
    - **Better Text Flow in Main Container**:
        - Added a general style for direct `<p>` children of `.container` to have `margin-bottom: var(--spacing-md);`, aiming to improve spacing for instructional texts.
        - Ensured direct `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` children of `.container` have `margin-bottom: var(--spacing-lg);` for clearer visual hierarchy of titles and major messages.
- **Guidance Provided for JavaScript Logic Changes**: 
    - Advised on JavaScript modifications to reduce message redundancy and improve user experience by:
        - Consolidating multiple completion messages into a single, clear, and engaging message when all evaluations are done.
        - Integrating the "Re-evaluate Again?" button more cohesively with the final completion status.
        - Ensuring instructional messages (like "Please evaluate your peers...") are conditionally displayed only when relevant (i.e., evaluations are pending). 

## [May 12, 2025] [04:10:35 AM UTC+8]

- **Implemented Phase 1: JavaScript Logic for Message De-cluttering and UI Flow**:
    - **`public/index.html`**:
        - Added a new `div` with `id="primaryCompletionMessage"` to display a single, consolidated message when all evaluations are complete.
        - Assigned `id="pendingEvaluationInstruction"` to the paragraph element that contains the text "Please evaluate your peers. Click on a name to start." for better JS control.
    - **`public/js/uiElements.js`**:
        - Added `export const pendingEvaluationInstruction = document.getElementById('pendingEvaluationInstruction');`.
        - (Selector for `primaryCompletionMessage` was previously added).
    - **`public/js/uiRenderer.js` (`updateMainUI` function)**:
        - Imported `pendingEvaluationInstruction` and `primaryCompletionMessage`.
        - Reworked the main UI update logic to manage the visibility of different sections and messages based on application state (`isUserLoggedIn`, `isEvaluationOpen`, `allEvaluationsDoneForCurrentUserInThisOpenPeriod`):
            - **When all evaluations are complete by the user**: 
                - Displays a new, prominent "Mission Accomplished..." message in `#primaryCompletionMessage`.
                - Hides the old `#welcomeMessage` (H2) and `#pendingEvaluationInstruction` (P tag).
                - Hides the original text content (H3 and P) within `#completionSection` but keeps `#completionSection` itself visible to show the `#reEvaluateButton`.
                - Peer list, summary, and stats remain visible.
            - **When evaluations are open and pending**: 
                - Shows `#welcomeMessage` (e.g., "Welcome, Alice! Ready to assess your squad?") and `#pendingEvaluationInstruction`.
                - Hides `#primaryCompletionMessage` and the original text in `#completionSection`.
            - **When evaluations are closed**: Shows `#evaluationClosedMessage` and hides other primary interaction elements, but still allows viewing of summary/stats if the user had completed their evaluations prior to closure.
        - This aims to significantly reduce redundant messages and provide a clearer, more context-aware user interface. 

## [May 12, 2025] [12:12:00 PM UTC+8]

- **Debugging Chart Display & Submission UI Issues (Initial Phase)**:
    - Added detailed `logDebug` statements within the `renderEvaluationChart` function in `public/js/uiRenderer.js` to trace its execution flow and identify reasons for the chart not appearing.
    - Analyzed console logs which revealed that `renderEvaluationChart` was not being called. This led to investigation of the submission process and UI updates.
    - Identified a `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` error post-submission, initially suspected to interfere with Firestore writes and UI refresh, though later found not to be the primary blocker for all users/scenarios.
    - Advised user to disable browser extensions and/or use incognito mode for testing.

## [2025-05-12 12:30:00 UTC+8] - Resolved Critical Firebase Permissions and Early Submission Bugs

- **Addressed Firebase Permissions Issues**:
    - Investigated `FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions` errors that appeared after clearing site data, impacting `firestoreService.listenToAppSettings` and other Firestore operations.
    - **Temporarily adjusted `firestore.rules`** to be more permissive during debugging (e.g., `allow read, write: if request.auth != null;` for relevant paths) to isolate permissions as a root cause. This helped confirm that overly restrictive rules were contributing to problems.
    - **Ensured correct initialization order in `public/js/main.js`**: Verified and enforced that `authService.performAnonymousSignIn()` completes *before* `initializeAppListeners()` (which calls `firestoreService.listenToAppSettings`). This resolved permission errors for anonymous users trying to access app settings before full anonymous sign-in.
    - *These steps were crucial for unblocking the UI update for individual peer submissions, which in turn was necessary to reach the "all evaluations complete" state for chart rendering.*

- **Corrected Evaluation Submission Logic in `public/js/evaluationManager.js`**:
    - **Fixed function call typo**: Changed a call from the non-existent `firestoreService.saveSummarizedEvaluationToFirestore` to the correct `firestoreService.saveSummarizedEvaluation`. This was preventing summarized evaluations from being saved.
    - This fix, combined with the `firestoreService` namespace import fix (logged under 12:42:00), restored the ability to save summaries.

- **Addressed UI Data Propagation Issue in `public/js/uiRenderer.js`**:
    - **Fixed destructuring typo in `updateMainUI`**: Corrected `const { ..., summarizedEvaluations, ... } = appState;` to `const { ..., userSummarizedEvaluations, ... } = appState;`. This ensured that `updateMainUI` correctly accessed the `userSummarizedEvaluations` property from the `appState` object, which was critical for the chart to receive data once summaries were successfully passed.

## [2025-05-12 12:42:00 UTC+8]

- **Fixed `firestoreService` Reference Error in `public/js/evaluationManager.js`**:
    - Modified `public/js/evaluationManager.js` to correctly import and utilize the `firestoreService` module.
    - Changed from specific named imports to a namespace import (`import * as firestoreService from './firestoreService.js';`).
    - Updated all calls to functions from `firestoreService` (e.g., `submitEvaluation`, `saveSummarizedEvaluation`, `fetchUserSummarizedEvaluations`, etc.) to use the `firestoreService.` prefix.
    - *This, along with the function name correction noted at 12:30:00, resolved errors preventing summarized evaluations from being saved and causing subsequent issues with UI updates and chart display.*

## [2025-05-12 12:48:00 UTC+8]

- **Enhanced Firestore Save & UI Update Logic**:
    - Modified `public/js/firestoreService.js` (`saveSummarizedEvaluation` function):
        - Added detailed logging for incoming data and data being prepared for Firestore.
        - Included `evaluationPeriodId` in the data saved to Firestore and in the query to check for existing summary documents. This makes a summary unique by evaluator, evaluated peer, and evaluation period.
        - Switched to using `serverTimestamp()` for the `timestamp` field for better data integrity.
        - Added more robust checks for `undefined` values in the data before attempting to save to Firestore, to prevent errors.
    - Modified `public/js/uiRenderer.js` (`updateMainUI` function):
        - Added more detailed logging at the start of the function to show the complete `appState` it receives, specifically `allEvaluationsDoneForCurrentUserInThisOpenPeriod` and the count/content of `userSummarizedEvaluations` (reflecting corrected variable name). This helps diagnose why the UI might not immediately transition to the 'all done' state.

## [2025-05-12 12:57:00 UTC+8]

- **Refined State Handling for Chart Display**:
    - Modified `public/js/evaluationManager.js` (`checkCompletionInternal` function):
        - When all evaluations are complete and summaries are fetched, these summaries are now passed directly to the `onCompletionStatusChange` callback (which is `main.js#refreshUI`).
        - Adjusted logic to pass empty arrays or existing state summaries in other branches to ensure the callback always receives an array if expected.
    - Modified `public/js/main.js` (`refreshUI` function):
        - Updated `refreshUI` to accept an optional `explicitSummaries` parameter.
        - If `explicitSummaries` are provided (e.g., from `evaluationManager` after the final evaluation), `refreshUI` now uses these directly to populate the `userSummarizedEvaluations` field in the `currentState` object passed to `uiRenderer.updateMainUI`. This bypasses potential stale data from `state.getState()` for this specific property in this critical path.
        - The callback from `handleSubmitEvaluation` in `attachEventListeners` was updated to expect summaries and pass them to `refreshUI`.
    - Modified `public/js/uiRenderer.js` (`updateMainUI` function):
        - Added more detailed logging at the very beginning of the function to directly inspect `appState.userSummarizedEvaluations` and its length upon entry.
        - Added logging just before `renderEvaluationChart` is called to confirm the summaries and their count at that point.
    - *These changes, building upon the earlier typo fixes and permissions resolutions, aimed to ensure `uiRenderer.updateMainUI` consistently received up-to-date summarized evaluation data to trigger chart rendering.*

## [2025-05-12 13:07:36 UTC+8] - Refactored `evaluationManager.js` (`checkCompletionInternal` and `setupEvaluationUI`) to ensure reliable chart display on page refresh for completed users. Removed premature UI refresh from `setupEvaluationUI` and strengthened summary fetching logic within `checkCompletionInternal`, including passing `currentEvaluationPeriodId` to `fetchUserSummarizedEvaluations`. 

[2025-05-12 13:09:52 UTC+8] - Made `evaluationManager.checkCompletionInternal` async and updated its callers (`setupEvaluationUI`, `handleSubmitEvaluation`) to await it. This ensures that summary fetching and the subsequent UI refresh call (via `onCompletionStatusChange`) complete before the calling functions proceed, fixing an issue where the chart wouldn't appear on refresh for an already completed user due to a premature UI update.
